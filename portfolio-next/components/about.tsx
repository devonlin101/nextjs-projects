        I immigrated to the United States from China when I was 18 year old.
        After dropping out of college around the end of 2012, I worked as a
        delivery driver in a small Chinese restaurant till late 2018. I saved up
        and took a break from a delivery driving job, starting to plan my
        future. I searched online for better, high pay careers without any
        college degree. The software engineer and web developer show up with
        many other better high pay careers that do not require a degree. Why did
        I choose to be a web developer? Web developers and software engineers
        are all about coding, algorithm and data structure, and how to
        manipulate these skills to build applications and games. First, I have
        consumed a quarter of my life playing variety of games, and spent one
        third of my life with a laptop computer . Second, I also believe myself
        to be a smart, intelligent and clever guy. Since then, I have been
        self-studying web development and striving to become proficient in
        JavaScript and Rust programming languages intermittently.
