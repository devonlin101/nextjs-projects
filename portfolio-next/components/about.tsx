        I immigrated to the United States from China when I was 18 year old.
        After dropping out of college at the end of 2012, I worked as a delivery
        driver in a small chinese restaurant till late year of 2018. Then I was
        thinking about my future, so I searched online for better, high pay
        careers without a college degree. Web developer and software engineer
        showed up on my computer screen. I have loved playing games since I was
        child which including gameboy, computer games etc. and I have already
        spent quarter of life on game. Web Developer and software engineering is
        about using code to build applications and games. I also believe myself
        to be a smart, intelligent and clever guy. Since then, I have been
        studying web development and proficient in Javascript and Rust
        programming languages till now.
