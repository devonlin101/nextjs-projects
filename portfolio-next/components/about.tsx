        I immigrated to the United States from China when I was 18 year old.
        After dropping out of college around the end of year 2012, I worked as a
        delivery driver in a small Chinese restaurant till late 2018. I saved up
        and took a break from a delivery driving job, then started to search for
        a better career. I looked up online for high pay careers that does not
        required any college degree. Then the software engineer and web
        developer show up with many other better high pay careers on the list.

        Why did I choose to be a web developer? Web developers and Software
        engineers are all about coding, system design, algorithm, data structure
        and problem solving, and how to manipulate these skills to build fully
        functional applications and games. First, I have consumed a quarter of
        my life playing variety of games, spent one third of my life with a
        computer. Second, also I believe myself to be a smart, intelligent,
        clever, detail oriented and hard working guy, these are traits for a
        successful web developer and software developer . Since then, I have
        been self-studying web development and striving to become proficient in
        JavaScript and Rust programming languages intermittently.
